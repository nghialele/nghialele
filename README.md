## Xin chao, my name is Nghia.

### Bedroom Developer. #notaprodev
I am learning:
- Networking
- Cybersecurity
- Docker & Homelab

I do some meaningless stuff online, include:
- Hosting 2 gameservers for DayZ players in my country for the sake of lowest latency.
- Doing some *homelab* thingy, this is addiction, do not try.
- Idling 3 Syncthing Relays around the world for ~~people~~ data hoarder to transfer their files.
- Randomly select some music for a self-hosted radio channel.

**I follow a LET legend @yoursunny to do 5 push-ups a day.**
